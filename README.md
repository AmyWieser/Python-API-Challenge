# Python-API-Challenge

Part 1 – Weatherpy

In this project I analyzed 500+ cities around the world and their location in reference to the equator to see if there are correlations between their location and the average temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speeds.

Through my analysis, I observed:
1. There is not much of a correlation between wind speeds and the latitude of the cities
2. Cities in the Southern hemisphere tend to have warmer temps than those in the Northern hemisphere
3. Temperatures tend to drop as the latitude increases
